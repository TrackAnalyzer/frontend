                    This application allows you to analyze your own laps and compare them to your opponents laps.
                    We also have a leaderboard with a custom ranking system to see who is the best.
                    We also allow yoy to view the current performance of the kart which allows you to pick the best kart

                                                                                                      style={linkStyle}>leaderboard</Link>.
                    if you can't find your heat or laps you can add them yourself by entering the heat id in the input
                    field above.
                    You can find your heat id in the email that you got send after the heat. the heatid is present in
                    the url of the results page.

                    this project has been created because i wanted to be more competative when karting. so i made this
                    application for my local karting track.
                    using this application i was able to estemate the best kart for the day and improve my consistency
                    at the track

                    If you have any feature request feel free to create a issue on the repo.
